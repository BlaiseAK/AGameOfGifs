# AGameOfGifs

In this webpage you will find a series of buttons with the theme being Marvel comicbook superheroes. If you select one of the buttons you will find 10 still pictures of that hero added to your screen. If you click on these images they will animate and become gifs and if clicked again they will change back to still pictures. You've been provided some heroes as buttons already but I have included an input field for you to create your own buttons. You may add other Heroes or villians if you so choose, also I invite you to add DC comicbook characters if that is something that interests you. Please keep in mind that none of the gifs and pics that are shown here I do not own. I do not make determinations of what content is rated, that right belongs to Giphy.com but the max is a rating of "PG-13."
